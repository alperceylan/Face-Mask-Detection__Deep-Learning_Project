# **Face Mask Detection Project**

You can find the detailed explanation in the "mask_detection_webcam1.py" folder.


The use of masks during the pandemic process has become one of the inevitable measures to suppress
transmission and save lives. Although experts and politicians constantly recommend social distancing and
using masks, the spread of the virus continues. Despite the measures taken and the rules set, the use of
masks does not reach the desired level. Because of this, the pandemic cannot be stopped, deaths and cases
continue.

As the pandemic process continues, I think the use of masks should become widespread, so I decided to
write a mask detection program that can facilitate this process. What I want from the program is that the
camera detects the person and detects whether that person is wearing a mask. If there are people who do
not wear masks, it is detected by the program and the authorities take action.

(NOTE : The descriptions of the codes are in the **mask_detection_webcam1.py** file.)

(NOTE : I completed the project from start to finish by myself. And I'm also working on new projects.)
